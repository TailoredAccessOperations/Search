<summary>Why is this open sourced?</summary>
<br>
Originally, I had not planned to open source this project. However, a turn of events has led me to reconsider this decision. A former collaborator, who was part of the project but did not contribute to the backend development, coding, or design—areas where I exclusively worked—began to show an unexpected interest in the detailed setup and operation of the project just before their departure. They did not contribute any suggestions or code during their time with the project.

Their inquiries intensified suddenly, focusing on how to get the project started, where the problems in the original code were, and how various components were supposed to function. This occurred despite the known issues with the original version hosted at searchl.0t.rocks, which included a non-functional wallet system and broken setup scripts.

After they left, I learned through mutual contacts at a convention that they were attempting to sell the project. Given these circumstances, I have decided to open source the project to protect its integrity and ensure that its use aligns with my terms and conditions. This decision is meant to reflect the true scope of my contributions and safeguard the project's original vision.
