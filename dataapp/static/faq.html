    <h1>FAQ:</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>Is this legal?</dt>
        <dd>Maybe. Depending on your region, it may be illegal to access this data. In the USA, it's not illegal to access leaked data.</dd><br />

        <dt>I want my data removed!</dt>
        <dd>You always contact me via email: <a href="mailto:miyako@miyako.rocks">miyako@miyako.rocks</a> or Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/miyakoyako">@miyakoyako</a> with a <em>reasonable</em> request for free removal. Unreasonable requests (i.e. "Delete every gmail address!" or "My uncle is a very powerful person delete my data or I will sue you" (yes this actually happened)) will be ignored and/or met with mockery.</dd><br />

        <dt>This password is hashed, will you crack it for me?</dt>
        <dd>No. There are many services that will crack passwords for you, free and paid.</dd><br />

        <dt>This website is ugly!</dt>
        <dd>lol ya</dd><br />

        <dt>Are my requests being logged?</dt>
        <dd>For all intents and purposes, Yes. It's impossible for any site to prove that user requests aren't being logged, and given that I'm using Cloudflare, I'm sure logs are being kept somewhere outside of my knowledge. That being said, I don't particularly care what you search.</dd><br />

        <dt>Ok, but what data are you storing on me?</dt>
        <dd>Access logs + analytical data.</dd><br />

        <dt>Why is this free?</dt>
        <dd>To spite <a href="/dear_peter">Peter Kleissner</a>. I make money from automated exports and donations.</dd>
